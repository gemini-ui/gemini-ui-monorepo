Alerts display small messages to the user in a view that stands out to draw attention.

You can use the Alert component for multiple purposes such as informing the user about a successful operation, warning the user about a potential issue, or notifying the user about an error.

## Component

### Basic Usage

```astro live
---
import { Alert } from "@gemini-ui-astro/components";
---

<Alert dynamicGlow severity="success">This is a success alert</Alert>
```

### Different Severity Levels

```astro live
---
import { Alert } from "@gemini-ui-astro/components";
---

<Alert dynamicGlow severity="success">This is a success alert</Alert>
<Alert dynamicGlow severity="error">This is an error alert</Alert>
<Alert dynamicGlow severity="info">This is an info alert</Alert>
<Alert dynamicGlow severity="warning">This is a warning alert</Alert>
```

The Alert component supports four severity levels: `success`, `error`, `info`, and `warning`. Each severity level has a different color and pulse color to indicate the type of message.

### Pulse Animation

```astro live
---
import { Alert } from "@gemini-ui-astro/components";
---

<Alert dynamicGlow severity="success" pulse="infinite">
  This is a success alert with infinite pulse
</Alert>
```

The pulse is used to draw attention to the alert. It can be used to indicate that the alert is important or requires immediate attention.
