<Styles />

Use typography to present your copy as clearly as possible to the user taking into account accessibility.

## Component

### Basic Usage

```astro live
---
import { Typography } from "@gemini-ui-astro/components";
---

<Typography variant="h1">This is an H1 heading</Typography>
<Typography variant="h2">This is an H2 heading</Typography>
<Typography variant="h3">This is an H3 heading</Typography>
<Typography variant="h4">This is an H4 heading</Typography>
<Typography variant="h5">This is an H5 heading</Typography>
<Typography variant="h6">This is an H6 heading</Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1">This is a subtitle1</Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle2">This is a subtitle2</Typography>
<Typography variant="body1">This is an body1 paragraph</Typography>
<Typography variant="body2">This is an body2 paragraph</Typography>
<Typography variant="caption">This is a caption paragraph</Typography>
<Typography variant="overline">This is an overline paragraph</Typography>
```

### Changing the semantic element

It is important to maintain semantics in your HTML, search engines rank sites based on an ordered heirachy. However, there are times when it may not appear visually appealing to do this.

You may need to take the styling of one element and use it on another. You can do this by using the `as` prop.

```astro live
---
import { Typography } from "@gemini-ui-astro/components";
---

<Typography variant="h3" as="h2">
  This is an H2 heading with an H3 override
</Typography>
```

This creates an `h2` element with the styles of an `h3` element.

## API

The `Typography` component has the following props.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Default</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>variant</td>
      <td>
        "h1" | "h2" | "h3" | "h4" | "h5" | "h6" | "subtitle1" | "subtitle2" |
        "body1" | "body2" | "caption" | "overline";
      </td>
      <td>default</td>
      <td>Defines which element is used</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>as</td>
      <td>"h1" | "h2" | "h3" | "h4" | "h5" | "h6" | "p" | "span"</td>
      <td>-</td>
