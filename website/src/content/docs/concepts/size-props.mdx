import { Styles } from "@gemini-ui-astro/styles";

<Styles />

Size props in Gemini UI allow you to specify sizes in a consistent way across components. This helps to ensure that your UI is visually consistent.

## Usage

Size props accept a whole number or a string between 0 and 8. The corresponding size is determined globally by the `Styles` component. See the [Configuration](/guides/2-configuration) for more information.

```astro live
---
import EmojiSatisfiedRegular from "@gemini-ui-astro/components/icons/regular/EmojiSatisfiedRegular";
---

<EmojiSatisfiedRegular size="8" />
```

Size props also accept arbitrary CSS values:

```astro live
---
import EmojiSatisfiedRegular from "@gemini-ui-astro/components/icons/regular/EmojiSatisfiedRegular";
---

<EmojiSatisfiedRegular size="4rem" />
```
