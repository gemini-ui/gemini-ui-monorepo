The dynamic glow effect is an effect supported by many of the Gemini UI components. It applies a glowing effect to the component, which moves dynamically based on the position of the mouse cursor. This gives sites a more interactive and engaging feel.

## Basic Usage

```astro live
---
import { DynamicGlow } from "@gemini-ui-astro/components";
import { Grid, Card } from "@gemini-ui-astro/components";
---

<DynamicGlow />

<Grid container gap="4">
  <Grid xs={12} sm={6}>
    <Card dynamicGlow>A</Card>
  </Grid>
  <Grid xs={12} sm={6}>
    <Card dynamicGlow>A</Card>
  </Grid>
  <Grid xs={12} sm={6}>
    <Card dynamicGlow>A</Card>
  </Grid>
  <Grid xs={12} sm={6}>
    <Card dynamicGlow>A</Card>
  </Grid>
</Grid>
```

## CSS API

It's possible to customise the dynamic glow effect, or use it with your own components, by using the CSS API.

The `DynamicGlow` component injects a script in the page which will search for any element with the `gx-dynamic-glow` class and apply CSS variables to it which can be used to customise the glow effect.

The following CSS variables will be set by the script:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`--gx-element-width`</td>
      <td>number</td>
      <td>The width of the element.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`--gx-element-height`</td>
      <td>number</td>
      <td>The height of the element.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`--gx-mouse-distance-x`</td>
      <td>number</td>
      <td>
        The horizontal distance from the mouse cursor to the nearest edge of the
        elements bounding box. The value is 0 when the cursor is hovering the
        element.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`--gx-mouse-distance-y`</td>
      <td>number</td>
      <td>
        The vertical distance from the mouse cursor to the nearest edge of the
        elements bounding box. The value is 0 when the cursor is hovering the
        element.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`--gx-mouse-distance`</td>
      <td>number</td>
      <td>
        The distance from the mouse cursor to the nearest edge of the elements
        bounding box. The value is 0 when the cursor is hovering the element.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`--gx-mouse-angle`</td>
      <td>number</td>
      <td>
        The angle from the mouse cursor to the nearest point on the edge of the
        elements bounding box.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`--gx-mouse-progress-x`</td>
      <td>number</td>
      <td>
        The fraction of the component across which the mouse has travelled in
        the horizontal direction. The value is between 0 and 1.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`--gx-mouse-progress-y`</td>
      <td>number</td>
      <td>
        The fraction of the component across which the mouse has travelled in
        the vertical direction. The value is between 0 and 1.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

To avoid an infinite loop, ensure that you do not use these variables in a way which will cause the components position or size to change.

### Example

```astro live
---
import { DynamicGlow } from "@gemini-ui-astro/components";
---

<span class="gx-dynamic-glow">Dynamic glow example</span>

<style>
  span {
    transform: rotate(var(--gx-mouse-angle));
  }
</style>
```

As shown in the example above, the CSS properties can be used to create arbitrary effects.
