import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Alert } from "@gemini-ui-astro/components";
import { Styles } from "@gemini-ui-astro/styles";

<Styles />

To install Gemini UI run the following command

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">``` npm i @gemini-ui-astro/components ```</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn">``` yarn add @gemini-ui-astro/components ```</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<div style={{ marginTop: "48px" }}>
  <Alert severity="warning" dynamicGlow pulse="light">
    <span style={{ display: "block", marginTop: "-1rem" }}>
      Please note, this library is still under construction and may having
      breaking changes going forward. We will aim to minimise any impact with
      our future changes
    </span>
  </Alert>
</div>

## Setup

Most Gemini UI components adhere to configuration values set by a global `Styles` object. This should be included in each page where you are using Gemini UI components. One way to do this is to create a layout component that includes the `Styles` object and wrap your pages with it.

```astro
---
import { Styles } from "@gemini-ui-astro/components";
---

<Styles />
```

For more information about the `Styles` object, see the [Styles API](/guides/2-configuration).

## Basic Usage

After installation, you can import any Gemini UI component and start playing around. For example, try changing the `dynamicGlow` on the Card to see how the style changes:

```astro live
---
import { Card } from "@gemini-ui-astro/components";
---

<Card>This is a card</Card>
```

## Dynamic Glow

The `dynamicGlow` prop is available on many Gemini UI components and adds a dynamic glow effect to the component. This is a great way to make your site feel more interactive and engaging.

To enable usage of the `dynamicGlow` prop, add the `DynamicGlow` component to pages where you are using Gemini UI components. For example, this could be added to a layout component:

```astro
---
import { DynamicGlow } from "@gemini-ui-astro/components";
---

<DynamicGlow />
```

This prop can then be used as follows:

```astro live
---
import { Alert } from "@gemini-ui-astro/components";
---

<Alert severity="info" dynamicGlow pulse="light">
  This is an alert with a dynamic glow effect
</Alert>
```
