description: A guide to setting up Gemini UI
---

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

To install Gemini UI run the following command

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">``` npm i @gemini-ui-astro/components ```</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn">``` yarn add @gemini-ui-astro/components ```</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Basic Usage

After installation, you can import any Gemini UI component and start playing around. For example, try changing the `dynamicGlow` on the Card to see how the style changes:

```astro live
---
import { Card } from "@gemini-ui-astro/components";
---

<Card dynamicGlow>This is a card with dynamic glow</Card>
```
