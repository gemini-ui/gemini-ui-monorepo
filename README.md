## Contributing

Gemini UI is still in pre-1.0 development and we don't yet have documentation for contributors. That said, the project is now stable enough to accept contributions, so feel free to raise a PR or an issue if you don't mind muddling through. If you're interested in getting involved with the project as a maintainer, please leave a comment on [this discussion](https://github.com/gemini-ui/gemini-ui-monorepo/discussions/40).
